#Autonomous Bot for Plant Care
Welcome to the Autonomous Bot for Plant Care repository! This project was developed during the "Hatch from Scratch" hackathon organized by IET BIT Mesra. Our aim is to simplify plant care tasks using advanced automation technology.

Overview
Our autonomous bot is designed to streamline plant maintenance by incorporating cutting-edge features:

Camera Detection System: The bot is equipped with a camera capable of identifying three different flower pots. Users can select a pot via a laptop interface, and the bot autonomously navigates to the chosen pot.

Moisture Level Measurement: Integrated with a moisture sensor, the bot assesses soil moisture levels upon reaching the designated pot. If the soil is dry, it activates a DC motor pump to moisturize the soil to the optimum level.

Gas Sensing Capability: Featuring an MQ2 gas sensor, the bot detects greenhouse gases within the flower pot, enabling effective monitoring of plant health using the greenhouse effect method.

Technologies Used
ESP8266: Powers the bot's communication and control system.
MQ2 Gas Sensor: Enables detection of greenhouse gases for plant health assessment.
Moisture Sensor: Facilitates accurate measurement of soil moisture levels.
