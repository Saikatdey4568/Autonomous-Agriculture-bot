## 🔥 Features & Capabilities  

### 📸 Smart Camera Detection  
🎥 The bot is **equipped with a camera** that can **identify three different flower pots**!  
💻 Users can **select a pot via a laptop interface**, and the bot will **autonomously navigate** to the chosen plant.  

### 💦 Intelligent Moisture Sensing  
🌱 The bot features a **moisture sensor** that checks the **soil's moisture level**.  
💧 If the soil is **too dry**, the bot **activates a DC motor pump** to water the plant **automatically**! 🚰  

### 🌿 Gas Sensing for Plant Health  
🌎 Equipped with an **MQ2 gas sensor**, the bot **detects greenhouse gases** in the flower pot.  
📊 This helps in **monitoring plant health** using the **greenhouse effect method**!
